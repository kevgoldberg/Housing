# Models Directory

Place model definition scripts, training routines, and saved model files here.

- Example: `baseline_model.py`, `train_model.py`, `predict.py`
- Store trained models in a subfolder like `models/saved/` (add to .gitignore)
- Document model architectures and training details in this README
