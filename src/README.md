# src Directory

Reusable code modules for data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.

The source code is organized into subpackages:

- `data/` - Loading and preprocessing utilities
- `analysis/` - Analysis helpers such as the correlation analyzer

Each subfolder contains an `__init__.py` so they can be imported as packages.
